# Dropout-Regularization-implementation-neural-Networks
This project demonstrates the concept and application of **Dropout Regularization** in deep learning models using TensorFlow/Keras. Dropout is a powerful technique to prevent overfitting by randomly "dropping" a subset of neurons during training, improving generalization on unseen data.
