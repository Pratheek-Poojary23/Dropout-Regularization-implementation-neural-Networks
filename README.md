# 🧠 Dropout Regularization in Neural Networks

This project demonstrates the concept and application of **Dropout Regularization** in deep learning models using TensorFlow/Keras. Dropout is a powerful technique to prevent overfitting by randomly "dropping" a subset of neurons during training, improving generalization on unseen data.

## 📌 Objective

The notebook aims to show the difference in performance (especially accuracy and loss curves) of a neural network with and without dropout applied, using a sample classification task.

## 📊 Overview

- Built a simple feedforward neural network using Keras
- Applied dropout layers between dense layers
- Compared training/validation accuracy and loss with and without dropout
- Visualized the effect of dropout on overfitting and model generalization

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- Python 
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 File Contents

- `dropout_regularization.ipynb`: Main notebook with model implementation, training results, and performance comparison.
